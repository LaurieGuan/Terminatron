# Terminatron
This is a small **terminal based game** I'm currently working on. It might end up being a clone of a pre-existing game or something completely new. My efforts are into creating a terminal renderering API in C/Assembly from scratch to learn the skills required to do so.

Keep in mind that I'm very early in my development carreer, so it's most likely going to be ***terrible code***. I'm however open to suggestions if you know anything that I don't that could serve usefull.

As far as compatibility is involved it is meant to be run on Linux systems, notably, for me under wsl. Do not ask for any windows implementation as as far I know, rendering text to the terminal in plain windows has terrible performance and runs like garbage. If you are on windows, install Debian under wsl and run it that way. It might even teach you some useful skills down the line.
